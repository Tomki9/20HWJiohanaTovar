    <div class="hi">
         Hi, I am Johana, 
         If you ask someone to describe me, you will hear something along the lines of creative, responsible, resourceful and kind. <br><br>
         I have always been fascinated with the concept of creating. I am someone that likes to create new things, from stories to websites. I am a self-motivated person, interested in working with people ready to take on challenges and share ideas, and work. <br><br>
         I have a degree in film production from UMB Colombia, Bogota, where I am originally from. This degree helps me to sensitize to art, design, and people. People that become histories. 
         <br><br> There is nothing like a good story. <br><br>
         Working in a team is essential to creating a film. It is important also to know how to express your ideas and the motivation behind them for your team to “make it true” your vision and help it make it through. Of course, we have limitations in budget, time, resources and this was more of an opportunity to be creative and flexible, to work with what we had. A valuable lesson to let go and adapt.
          More recently I earned a certificate in UX/UI design from the University of Central Florida (UCF). <br><br>
         My inner call of creation and storytelling was matched in a harmony I could have never predicted. This certificate taught me that I could use my creative thinking to produce user personas, for keeping the true north for how we are designing.  My film degree prepared me to create unique storyboards,  scenarios, and personas necessary to be empathetic to users. My curious side was delighted to learn how to prototype in Figma. I was surprised to see myself enjoying researching, testing and seeing the results of my work. My builder side was excited to learn the basics of code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
         <br><br> I am a creative person that takes delight in original ideas, production of projects, working with motivated people, and a job well done.

    <H3>User Research</H3>
    <P>I never thought that being a researcher was going to be so interesting. I started my journey shy and I ended it with an amazing growing curiosity on why do people do what they do!. That motivates me to investigate, to search for connections that create solutions.

<h3>User Interface Design</h3>
<P>Designing is a magical and unique experience. Design is creation. Creation is the opportunity to build, change, and even reconstruct I feel challenged and motivated to design. I enjoy being around creative people and working with them to bring from nowhere an idea, an idea that may transform what is written.

<h3>Web Develoment</h3>
<P>Learning a new language is hard, and it is rewarding when you see your progress. I recognize this is not my strongest skill But I am willing to learn, research, and ask to find the best way to code. learning how to code has reminded me of the importance of paying attention to every single detail.
